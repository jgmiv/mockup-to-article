I have learned how to use various tags to create emphasis and bold text along with adding hyperlinks to text.  

Creating bold, strike through, paragraphs, horizontal rule and emphasized text has been the easiest things to do.

I had to search a little more for the <a href = ””> to create the hyperlink in the text.

I have been searching the HTML cheatsheet and the MDN site for answers.
